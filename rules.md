# X-Team 12 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will determine what everyone's strengths and weaknesses are in order to work well as a group. We can communicate through text so that everyone is on the same page. 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will meet often in order to make sure that everyone stays up to date. 


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We can talk via text message as well as after class in order to figure out how to solve difficult tasks our group is faced with


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We can find times where we know everyone is available to make sure our group doesn't fall behind on projects


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
