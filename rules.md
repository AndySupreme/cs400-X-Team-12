# X-Team 12 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

1. We will determine what everyone's strengths and weaknesses are in order to work well as a group. We can communicate through text so that everyone is on the same page. 

2. We'll set up several tasks need to be completed per assignment, and then meet in groups to delagate who'd like to do what based on their interests and skills.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

1. We will talk via group chat messaging before and after meeting up (once a week), and check up on each other daily through the chat if we have questions or concerns while working individually on our own tasks. 

2. We will meet once a week in order to make sure that everyone stays up to date, and that we work to complete small goals in between each meeting.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

1. We can talk via text message as well as after class in order to figure out how to solve difficult tasks our group is faced with

2. We can also use email as a back up tool if one or more team mates is unavailable via text messages.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

1. Each of us has access to the master branch, so when someone is assigned a task and we're nearing the deadline that we assigned for their part, we will reach out to them and make sure they're on track to turn in their part.

2. We can find times where we know everyone is available to make sure our group doesn't fall behind on projects.

3. If anyone has any troubles with their portion, as a team, we will work to help the teammate that needs assistance. It is better to work together slower than work fast and leave someone behind.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

1. Work hard, have fun!
